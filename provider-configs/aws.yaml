# lambda alias has a nested map[string]float structure that confuses codegen
# this is actually a surprising bug, needs more investigation
 - aws_lambda_alias
# all of the following resources have duplicate nested fields, which creates
# duplicate/conflicting struct names.
# the plan to handle these is to add a stage to code generation where we 
# recursively search the field tree, renaming duplicates first-in-first-out,
# by walking back up the tree and prepending parent names
# until the result is unique
# note: we can also determine whether collisions are duplicates or conflicting
# but this is a bit more work and should be safe to leave as an improvement.
